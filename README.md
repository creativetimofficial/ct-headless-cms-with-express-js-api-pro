# Node API Setup

## Introduction

Express is a minimal and flexible framework Node.js web application. Express offers core features for creating an API:
- allows setting up a middleware for responding to HTTP requests
- helps with routing for different HTTP methods
- dynamically rendering HTML pages

For the data management was used MongoDB, a non-relational database that provides support for JSON-like storage.

[Click here to go to the MongoDB docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)

## Prerequisites

For your local development you need to have `Node.js` and `npm` version 16 or above installed and a registered MongoDB collection:
- For Windows: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows
- For Linux: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-linux/
- For Mac: https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html

## Project Installation

To install the project you need to have version 16 of Node.js and npm version 8. The first step is to run `npm install` command. Next you need to copy the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`. There are the variables for the database and the URLs:
- DB_USER=the-mongo-user-name
- DB_PASSWORD=mongo-password
- DB_NAME=name-of-the-db

- JWT_SECRET="token"

- APP_URL_CLIENT= with the default value of http://localhost:3000
- APP_URL_API= with the default value of http://localhost:8080

- add your mailtrap credentials in the MAILTRAP_USER and MAILTRAP_PASSWORD

## Usage

For a token-based authentication `passport` and `passport-jwt` modules were used. Also for managing the database, `mongoose` helped. Two scripts seeding and clearing the collections and documents are found in the `/src/mongoose`. The PRO version has multiple collections for: `users`, `roles`, `permissions` ,`categories`, `tags` and`items`.

To migrate and seed the tables the commands are:
- npm run seed
- npm run clear

To start the API you need to run the command `npm run start:dev`, and now, for example, your React project can use it by adding in your package.json `"proxy": "http://localhost:8080/"`. Check your .env variables to match your URLs.

Three different default users can be used for logging in:
- `admin@jsonapi.com` with the password `secret`
- `creator@jsonapi.com` with the password `secret`
- `member@jsonapi.com` with the password `secret`

The user can have 3 different roles with different permissions. The `permissions` table sets the rights of the user:
- an `admin` has all the rights, it can view, create, edit and delete users, roles, categories, tags and items
- a `creator` has limited rights, it can view, create, edit and delete categories, tags and items
- a `member` can edit its profile

It offers endpoint for login with the default users or it can register a new one. In the case of forgetting the password, the user can request a reset passsword and reset it.

Node API offers endpoints for common CRUD functionalities:
- Authentication API: login, logout, forget passwors and reset password
- Profile API: get profile, update profile
- Users Management: list, create, update, delete and upload profile image
- Roles API: create, update and delete
- Permissions API: list available permissions
- Categories Management API: list, create, update and delete
- Tags Management API: list, create, update and delete
- Items Management API: list, create, update, delete and upload item image
